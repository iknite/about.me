##### Jul 2020 - Nov 2021
Having the opportunity to collaborate with amazing companies led me to enroll myself in the journey of undust my company again, and provide crafted infrastructure to a selected few. **Technology is people**, so `iknite` relies on creating personal experiences instead of fast, untailored results. There are some highlights. 

- Banking Industries: Cloud-first banking is a great challenging task that I was able to manage, migrate and improve production-grade infrastructure through IaC, with terragrunt/terraform/atlantis and a lot of Architectural Decision Records.
- International Consultant: European contractor to Manage, migrate and improve tailor-made kubernetes clusters, in almost all possible PaaS, occasional tech speaker, and CKAD syllabus teacher.
- Data mining: Opendata governments allow us to have Terabytes of data to analyze, classify, and process. I'm had the mission to translate from "old school formats" to custom-tailored postgres.

##### Jan 2018 - Sep 2019
I'm proud to work in this strange powerhouse of engineering knowledge and creativity. This department has 3 exploratory areas, AI, Hyperscale, and Information Security. I've worked in all of them. 

- Hyperscale: Area responsible for unlocking the full potential of software development and networking. A clear example of that is QED which is a cryptographic verification for time-based events. https://github.com/bbva/qed My responsibilities in these projects include maximize the quality of the code, reduce the bridge between more skilled software engineers and traditional systems engineers, and present comprehensible and cohesible documentation for the project.

- Information Security: Creation of next-generation tooling for DevSecOps. I've been involved in the inception of this tool https://github.com/BBVA/patton-server. My job was to create the first MVP that blends the different data providers into a carefully-crafted PostgreSQL.

- AI: I've been involved in the creation of a python runtime engine that eases the creation of python microservices with automatic CI-CD integration. I've put a special effort to allow the creation of a tool that enables multi-cloud deployment,a language-agnostic interface, and a really small server footprint. Not to mention tensorflow out-of-the-box deployments via flavor configurations.

# A little More About me
I'm kind of a nerd in everything I put my mind to, like music. I have a small studio (if small are 5000+ vinyl and 10+ music gadgets & instruments). Even on Crossfit I love to read about technique details, I can't help myself. I suppose that's how my brain is rigged. 
- I'll always make time for a specialty coffee, old-school sci-fi, and category theory.
