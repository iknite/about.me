Father, information junkie and reckless learner. Lucky enough to love what I do.

# Experience

##### Jan 2018 - Present
I'm proud to work in this strange powerhouse of engineering knowledge and creativity. This department has 3 exploratory areas, AI, Hyperscale and Security. I've worked in all of them. 

- Hyperscale: Area responsible for unlocking the full potential of software development and networking. A clear example of that is QED which is a cryptographic verification for time-based events. https://github.com/bbva/qed My responsibilities in this projects include maximize the quality of the code, reduce the bridge between more skilled software engineers and traditional systems engineers and present a comprehensible and cohesible documentation for the project.

- Security: Creation of next generation tooling for SecDevOps. I've been involved in the inception of this tool https://github.com/BBVA/patton-server. My job was to create the first MVP that blends the different data providers into a carefully-crafted postgresql.

- AI: I've been involved in the creation of a python runtime engine that eases the creation of python microservices with automatic CI-CD integration. I've put a special effort to allow the creation of a tool that enables multi-cloud deployment, language-agnostic interface, and a really small server footprint. Not to mention tensorflow out-of-the-box deployments via flavour configurations.

# A little More About me
I'm kind of a nerd in everything I put my mind into, like music. I have a small studio (if small are 5000+ vinyl and 10+ music gadgets & instruments). Or Crossfit, I really love to read about technique, I can't help myself. I suppose that's how my brain is rigged. 
- I'll always make time for a good green coffee, old-school sci-fi and category theory.
